                <h4>Spike2Care takes privacy very seriously.</h4>
                <p>Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.</li>
                    <li>We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.</li>
                    <li>We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.</li>
                    <li>We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.</li>
                    <li>Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</li>
                    <li>We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</li>
                    <li>We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.</p>

                <h4>Secure Payments</h4>
                <p>Spike2Care has integrated Stripe for all monetary transactions. Spike2Care and Stripe comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Stripe has been audited by an independent PCI Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and is certified as a PCI Level 1 Service Provider. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.

                PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and Spike2Care. When accepting payments, in order to be PCI compliant, Spike2Care never stores (nor has access to) credit card data. Stripe does all the heavy lifting to protect all customersâ€™ card information.
