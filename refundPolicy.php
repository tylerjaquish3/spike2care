                	<h4>Spike2Care is committed to providing you with excellent service and transaction experience.</h4>
                	We issue full refunds for Spike2Care events, up to 5 days before the date of the event. Each refund takes 5-10 business days to process, and the amount will be refunded to the credit card used for the original payment. We recommend contacting Spike2Care for assistance if you experience any issues or concerns with payments or refunds.
                    <br /><br />
					<h4>Refunding Event Payments</h4>

					<!-- If your payment is found, and you are the team captain, you will be given options to refund the entire team or refund specific players. Refunding the entire team will send individual refunds to the account of each player that has registered and paid for the event. Refunding specific players will only issue a refund to the account of the selected registrants. If you are the captain and request a refund, the form will ask you to choose a new captain for the team.
